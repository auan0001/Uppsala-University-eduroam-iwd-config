#+title: Connect to eduroam using iwd at Uppsala university
Read the info and download the Python script found at [[https://mp.uu.se/en/web/info/stod/it-telefoni/it-support/network-on-campus/eduroam/linux]].

The installer puts the certificate at ~/home/cat_installer/ca.pem~ by default. Since the ~home~ directory might be protected, it is recommended to move the file elsewhere. Create a file named ~eduroam.8021~ in ~/var/lib/iwd/~ and fill in your username and Password B, as in the example below.

#+begin_src
# /var/lib/iwd/eduroam.8021x

[Security]
EAP-Method=PEAP
EAP-Identity=anonymous
# If you run the wpa_supplicant CAT installer
# the default location is /home/cat_installer/ca.pem.
# If /home is protected, make sure to move the .pem file, for example:
EAP-PEAP-CACert=/etc/ssl/certs/ca.pem
EAP-PEAP-Phase2-Method=MSCHAPV2
EAP-PEAP-Phase2-Identity=<abcd1234>@user.uu.se
EAP-PEAP-Phase2-Password=<passwordB>
EAP-PEAP-ServerDomainMask=radiusauth.uu.se

AutoConnect=True

If anything is incorrect, ~iwd~ will respond with ~Operation failed~. On my system, (~5.18.16-arch1-1~ using ~systemd-resolved~) ~iwd~ connected successfully without DNS working properly. I had to change the DNS to ~DNS=1.1.1.1#cloudflare-dns.com~ in my ~/etc/systemd/network/25-wireless.network~ file.
